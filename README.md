# mini-twitter-project-v1
A python version of twitter with several functions called PYTHONX.

## Summary

PYTHONX is a text-based social media simulator written in Python. Users can create accounts, log in, write posts, view a feed, like posts, and manage their accounts, all from a central while loop. I made it for my CS class.

This project demonstrates Python concepts such as dictionaries, lists, functions, loops, conditionals, and basic authentication logic.

## Functions

This program contains several functions:
1. **createaccount()** lets the user create an account.
2. **login()** is a function that lets the user log in.
3. **post()** lets the user post a tweet.
4. **viewfeed()** gives the user an interactive, personalized feed with some easter egg ads.
5. **like()** lets the user like a post outside of the feed (note: there is also a like feature inside the feed).
6. **editbio()** and **delpost()** are extra functions that allow a user to either edit their bio (editbio) or delete a post (delpost). These functions are extra functions and require an account.

### Functions Displayed on Main Menu:

1. Create a user
1. Write a post (account needed)
1. View the feed
1. Like a post
1. Exit
1. Extra features (account needed)

The extra features are (1) edit bio, and (2) delete post.

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.
2. Save the file as:
```
pythonx.py
```
3. Navigate to the folder containing the file.
4. Run the program using python.

## Later Projects
Later projects I made for my CS class, such as the mini twitter capstone project that my entire class worked on (https://github.com/danielolownia/Group-Twitter-Project), are in part based on this project.
